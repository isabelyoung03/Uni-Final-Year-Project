Week 1: This week I completed my project plan. I have also displayed my sprite on the GUI, as well as writing a function to display the maze. 
I need to work out how to separate and use the sprite sheet I have created.

Week 2: I have made a function to draw out the small maze based on the map for the small maze in the config file. I made a method for moving and tested this with the arrows keys.
I have started working on the menu page. I decided not to use a sprite sheet and use 4 individial sprites instead.

Week 3: I have completed the menu page. 
    11/10/2023: Today I completed the maps for the medium and large mazes.
