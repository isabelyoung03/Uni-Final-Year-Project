Week 1: This week I completed my project plan. I have also displayed my sprite on the GUI, as well as writing a function to display the maze. 
I need to work out how to separate and use the sprite sheet I have created.

Week 2: I have made a function to draw out the small maze based on the map for the small maze in the config file. I made a method for moving and tested this with the arrows keys.
I have started working on the menu page. I decided not to use a sprite sheet and use 4 individial sprites instead.

Week 3: I have completed the menu page. 
    11/10/2023: Today I completed the maps for the medium and large mazes. I have now finished the work I planned for this week.
                I am now going to begin next weeks work: depth and breadth first search.
                I have completed depth first search.

Week 4: 
    16/10/2023: Today I have started working on uniform-cost search. 
                I have prepared for this by creating a Ghost class and a factory class for it.
    18/10/2023: I have created an enum for ghost behaviour, and created a random movement behaviour to be used in uniform-cost maze.
                I have made it so that the path to the goal for uniform-cost is only recalculated if any of the ghosts move position.
                I just completed uniform-cost search for when the ghosts in the maze are static. The player avoids paths with ghosts in.
    19/10/2023: I have now completed uniform-cost search and starting on adding pause/play/replay buttons to maze screens.
