Week 1: This week I completed my project plan. I have also displayed my sprite on the GUI, as well as writing a function to display the maze. 
I need to work out how to separate and use the sprite sheet I have created.

Week 2: I have made a function to draw out the small maze based on the map for the small maze in the config file. I made a method for moving and tested this with the arrows keys.
I have started working on the menu page. I decided not to use a sprite sheet and use 4 individial sprites instead.

Week 3: I have completed the menu page. 
    11/10/2023: Today I completed the maps for the medium and large mazes. I have now finished the work I planned for this week.
                I am now going to begin next weeks work: depth and breadth first search.
                I have completed depth first search.

Week 4: 
    16/10/2023: Today I have started working on uniform-cost search. 
                I have prepared for this by creating a Ghost class and a factory class for it.
    18/10/2023: I have created an enum for ghost behaviour, and created a random movement behaviour to be used in uniform-cost maze.
                I have made it so that the path to the goal for uniform-cost is only recalculated if any of the ghosts move position.
                I just completed uniform-cost search for when the ghosts in the maze are static. The player avoids paths with ghosts in.
    19/10/2023: I have now completed uniform-cost search and starting on adding pause/play/replay buttons to maze screens.

Week 5: 
    25/10/2023: Today I have begun working on A* search. This is taking a lot of setup because it needs a special controller
                becaues it differs so much to the other algorithms I have implemented so far, because it has multiple goals to achieve
                and also requires options to change which heuristic it uses.
Week 6:
    30/10/2023: I have created a new Node class to be used in A* search. I am continuing with A* search, and having problems with the program crashing.
                I have made changes to the A* world controller as A* search will not have opponents.
    1/10/2023: Today I added the 2nd heuristic for A* search: Euclidian distance

Week 7:
    7/11/2023: I am still a week ahead of where I planned to be at this point.
                I have completed A* search where there is a cupcake in every cell of the maze.
                I am trying to find ways to optimise this and find the best possible route.
    8/11/2023: Today I improved the A* search algorithm by choosing the closest goal to go to next, reducing steps required

Week 8:
    15/11/2023: This week I am putting programming on hold for a bit to focus on my interim report and presentation.
    17/11/2023: I am adding in tests for the classes that I use. I have spent a long time today trying to deal with an issue
                with imports and python not being able to import any of my code into the test folder I made.
                I have been unable to resolve this problem so I have decided to leave all test files in the main directory
                instead of in a folder called "tests" because this is the only way they work.
